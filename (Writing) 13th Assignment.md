Dinosaurs in decline tens of millions of years before their final extinction by Sakamoto et al. (2016)

## Article Summary
In this article, Sakamoto et al. tries to find out evolutionary dynamics (speciation and extinction) of dinosaurs by using Bayesian phylogenetic approach. In their analysis, they used three dinosaur clades: Sauropodomorphs, Theropods, and Ornithischians. However, in Ornithischians, Ceratopsidae and Hadrosauriforms are excluded since their patterns are different from other Ornithischian taxons. Three phylogenetic trees are established to figure out evolutionary dynamics over Late Triassic to the end of dinosaur regin. In result, they found out that dinosaur speciation was exceeded by the extinction rate since 48-53 million years before K/Pg boundary. Within three clades of dinosaurs, each clades show different rates of speciation but, in broader picture, every clade show gradual speciation reducation. Sauropodomorphs could not restore their past diversity and speciation rate, even though Titanosaurs proliferated during the Cretaceous. Theropods show typical pattern of "early burst" of adaptive radiation and long protracte branches pattern. Birds also show same speciation rate as Theropods according to the insignificant result of regression parameter value. However, exclude birds (since they are still alive in 21st century), Theropods show gradually reduced speciation rate, too. Ornithischians show similar speciation pattern like Theropods (Increase speciation -> slowdown -> downturn) except the Hadrosauriforms and Ceratopsidae. Sakamoto et al. states that Hadrosauriforms and Ceratopsidae do not show pattern of slowdown and downturn of speciation pattern of other dinosaur clades. However, they conclude that these dinosaurs take part of only 14% of dinosaur species and their deviant pattern does not blur out the broader pattern. Sakamoto et al. suspect that the reduced speciation rate is due to the limited ecological niches. However, after measuring intraclade niche competition from cladewise lineage diversity model, the authors conclude that this is not the case. For alternative explanation, they suggest more geographic causes like sea level rise or continental fragmentation. 

## What I Liked About This Article
I liked the way that they use robust sampling and try to use different phylogenetic trees to approach this problem. Lack of sampling was always problem for the quantitative analysis of vertebrate paleontology. At least, it is glad to hear that samples are (somewhat) robust now to make actual analysis about dinosaur diversity and evolutionary dynamics. Also, I like the authors keep providing supportive explanations for their arguments. This makes paper more convincing and thought-provoking.  Even though it is only 4 pages long paper, they have 70 sources which is very numerous considering its length. Since dinosaur research is one of the most active field in paleontological world, this gives more support and reliability to this paper. The authors try to use Bayesian Phylogenetic approach for the first time to solve out the evolutionary dynamics. I think it was very effective approach with solid conclusion and worth effort.

> Just because they claimed the sampling was robust doesn't mean it actually was!

## What I Disliked About This Article
As a dinosaur maniac, this article gives me a lot of thinking. First suscipion was that they didn't reveal where they gathered their samples. Maybe it could be PBDB, but I found unreliability of the PBDB. I mean PBDB is the best friend for quantitative analysis of paleontology. However, it is not complete and somewhat messy. For example, just in case of dinosaur, data include bunch of ichnogenus and nomen dubiums. Yes, they still count as dinosaurs but, counting the species numberwise, it needs refinement to make it clear. I don't think authors did this. If they found this out from others paper, I found plausible candidates of these papers in the article. However, both papers are from 2008 and 2014. Dinosaur discovery is very active and 2 or 3 years passed papers might give difference in the actual pattern. Also, the authors use species level analysis, not genus level analysis. I wonder why they did this but they didn't give explain for this. If exclusion of Hadrosauriforms and Ceratopsids did not change the pattern of speciation of dinosaurs, then why the authors exclude them from Ornithischians? It would be better for me to understand if they include the graph with Ornithischians include Hadrosauriforms and Ceratopsids. One another major big thing gets me in this paper is the geologic bias. Paleontological record never fail to miss this. Even though the authors use robust sample to find out, there's always a geologic bias in dinosaurs. I think authors forgot to mention this in paper either.

## Evaluation of Figures and Graphs
They are okay. They well visualize the message this paper is trying to convey and they were helpful for me to understand the paper. 

> This is a very weak analysis of the figures.
