> Good job. Final grade 18.2/20

1) 
+ Species A -> 3,12,13,15
+ Species B -> 18,24
+ Species C -> 7,9,10,17
+ Species D -> 4,22,25
+ Species E -> 5,23
+ Species F -> 8,11,20,21 
+ Species G -> 14,16,19
+ Species H -> 1,2,6

> That's a lot of species!

First, shell morphology was used to determine each species. Afterwards, their stratigraphic range was compared to determine they were same species or not. However, there is an exception of some speices with large stratigraphic range (Still, they are considered as same speices because of their similiarity in their morphology). Afterwards, their D and UD/WD ratio were compared to make this observation concrete. 

2) Shape of shell, Diameter, UD/WD ratio

3) Ontogenic change is determined by difference in shell size (+ diameter) and degree of involution, mostly. Their WD was also in considered since I suspected that the proportion of shell would change over ontogenic change. Best example for ontogenic change is species G. It's WD ratio is decreasing over time but also diameter is significantly increasing as it becomes bigger shell. Also, degree of colining is also shown in Species C. 

4) Since sexual dimorphism is usually expressed as shell size difference, sexual dimorphism is determined by change in shell size (+ diameter) and almost similar UD/WD ratio. Species F seems to show sexual dimorphism. It has clear distinction between shell diameter (8 & 11/20 &21) but still almost similar UD/WD ratio between two shell groups.

## Part 2
#### Part 1

> What about the other objects in the list? -0.25 points

3) three dimension

> What are they? -0.25 points

## Part 2

1) land

2) ProcrustesHummingbirds<-gpagen(hummingbirds[["land"]])

3) plotTangentSpace(ProcrustesHummingbirds[["coords"]],warpgrids=FALSE,verbose=FALSE)

[Part 3]
Part 1
1. Fangs longer than 6 inches
2. Sulfurous odor
3. Adorable eyelashes
4. C, D, and E
5. Laser death ray
6. Both. It can be synapomorphic for species A and B, and can be autapomorphic between species A & B and species C, D, & E. 

> That wasn't the question.

7. Family 1 -> Monophyletic 
   Family 2 -> Polyphyletic
   Family 3 -> Monophyletic

Part 2
1. It is not advisable. Because species A does not have any synapomporphy with species D and E.
2. Group 1 -> Paraphyletic
   Group 2 -> Monophyletic
   Group 3 -> Paraphyletic 
   Group 4 -> Monophyletic
   Group 5 -> Polyphyletic

[Part 4]
1. For Gryphaea mccullochi, peramorphosis. And for Gryphaea gigantea,paedomorphosis
2. Gryphaea mccullochi

> You didn't explain your reasoning. -0.5 points.

3. Paedomorphosis
