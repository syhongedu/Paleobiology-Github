How good was the fossil record? Clues from the Californian Pleistocene by James W. Valentine (1989)

## Article Summary

In this article, Valentine compares similarity of the shell assemblages of Bivalves and Gastropods between modern and Pleistocene (last one million year ago) in California province. From this dataset, the author tries to find out not only how similar the assemblages between two time periods but also why there¡¯s a difference in fossil record and evaluate how well these fossils are preserved. His collection shows that there¡¯s 80.1% similarity in living and fossil Bivalve assemblages and 75.6% similarity in living and fossil Gastropod assemblages. Furthermore, this similarity is significantly increasing towards higher taxonomic level. In family level, Bivalvia reaches 90.6% similarity and Gastropoda hits 88.3% of similarity. Therefore, the author concludes that this is fairly well preserved fossil assemblage (536 species in common, 162 modern species lack in fossil record, 211 fossil species lack in modern record). 

Valentine suggests various reasons to explain the factors which hinder the fossilization. From comparison between modern and fossil taxon, the author finds out that rare species, minute/fragile shells, and deeper-shelf-dwelling species show the low possibility of fossilization so that leads to the missing record in fossil assemblage. Moreover, the author states the loss of hard-shelled shell fossils are due to the post-fossilization ¡°accident¡± such as erosion, burial or destruction of fossil during discovery. 

## What I liked About Paper
First thing I liked about this paper is that the author brought out fairly solid conclusion. By comparing fossil specimens with close or exactly same specimens, Valentine was able to induce out almost exact ecological habits of these Mollusks which help him and me to understand what and why some Mollusks are less or unpreserved in fossil records. His conclusion was very persuasive and well-supported by the analogy with the modern taxa.

Also, I liked how solid the dataset Valentine has collected. Paleontology is renowned for lack of number of samples. This always brings unresolved issues behind to solve the mystery. However, the number of the samples (both living and the fossil) author collected are fairly abundant that the large amount of direct comparison was available, which helped to bring more accurate result out. Valentine¡¯s age choice was very clever, too. One million year is the range of somewhat-old to not-so-old-in-geological-time-context. This would reduce the further distortion in fossil preservation and keep most of modern taxon for better comparison.

## What I Disliked About Paper
One thing I disliked (little bit) about this paper is that the author based on his conclusion solely on morphological stance. Yes, morphology is the most important factor in paleontology. Because that what we have the most. So, it is very important and Valentine¡¯s conclusion is very solid when it comes to morphological standpoint. 

> What is the atlternative? Also I don't understand why you go from talking about morphological features to geological features between these two sentences. I don't see how these sentences are related.

However, I want to point out the lack of geological standpoint. Valentine mentions the prevalence of shallow water taxa and lack of deep water taxa in fossil record. However, Valentine did not mention proper lithology of the rocks which preserve these fossil records. Biological proxies are important factors in paleoecological perspective. However, life of animal is molded by the environment. Geological factors are, in my opinion, very important to understand the biology and ecology of extinct species. Even though modern and extinct taxa had same morphology, they might have different physiology or lifestyle. This paper is about fossil preservation. So, yes, what the author brings up in the table is very solid and concrete. However, this paper would be more convincible if the author considers various aspects of fossilization itself and look this issue in much diverse direction, not only in morphological standpoint.

## Evaluating Graphs and Figures
There are not many graphs and figures in this paper. Only one figure to show where the fossil records are collected and table to show the result. Figure was okay but not significant. However, table was very useful for me to understand. Honestly, table summarizes entire result of the paper. It would be better if the author attached the pictures of modern and Pleistocene shells, though.
