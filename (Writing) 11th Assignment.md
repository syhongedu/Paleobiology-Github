The effect of geographic range of extinction risk during background and mass extinction by Payne & Finnegan (2007)

## Article Summary

In this article, Payne & Finnegan are trying to explain the difference between background and mass extinction by using geographic range selectivity as a proxy. Geographic range is supposed to be the most renowned determinants of extinction risk. Therefore, the authors believe that using geographic range is the best way to distinguish between background and mass extinction. They used marine benthic invertebrates for the data and used 500 million years of time scale (from Middle Cambrian to Middle Miocene). The authors used logistic regression to analyze the data since results is binary rather than continuous. The odd ratio is calculated to find out the association between odd of survival and geographic range. From their data, species richness, number of global occurrences, heterogenity and incompleteness of fossil record are dismissed because they do not affect significantly on their result. From their result, Payne and Finnegan found out that geograhpic range and extinction selectivity are positively correlated. However, they also found out that this association is somewhat blurred when it comes to large scale mass extinction (such as P-T, T-J, and K-Pg) and 2nd level extinction (such as Late Ordovician and Late Devonian). Only difference between them is that 2nd level extinction shows more selectivity than mass extinction itself. The authors found out that geographic range does not matter much in mass extinction because it is global perturbation and it affects to every ecologically and physiologically similar genera. However, even though large-scaled extinctions may blur the effect of geograhpic range, this paper clearly shows that geographic range is important factor in background extinction and mass extinction is clearly defined from background extinction by this factor.

## What I Liked About Paper

First thing I found out from paper is that this paper is full of explanations. Even though it was hard to explain, the authors try their best to get rid of uncertainties in this paper. For example, result part, they provide every uncertain parts (such as incompleteness and heterogenity of the fossil record) null in this paper and do not have to care about them at all. It is rare to find out paper which is packed with explanation to reduce uncertainty and bring results in more precise level.

Also, even though it is hard to read, this paper is somewhat interesting to read because it shows how geographic range matters with extinction events. Especially, it was very thought provoking and gives me more ideas to understand extinctions, especially mass extinctions. If mass extinction is mostly irrelevant to geographic range, there would be more ways to actually understand the mechanism for this and this paper gives very good explanation to solve this issue. 

## What I Disliked About Paper

One thing I disliked about this paper is that it is very statistically loaded. I have never taken any statistics class before and this gives me really hard time to read and understand the paper (I know I am complaining this a lot but still it gets me a lot!). Even though they throw some background informations for low-level-statistic-background readers, this paper is still hard to read without understanding log-odds and various relationships between variables.

Also, the loads of information can be double-edge of sword. It helps for me to have some amount of explanation but, as it gets longer and more, I lost my focus and makes me more focused. Just for my opinion, this paper would be much easier to read and understand if the authros write in more simplified  way to explain the results/discuss. 

> I can understand that. The class was a little divided on this. Some felt it was too statistical, but others though it was very readable.

## Evaluate Graph and Figures

I liked the graph and figures because they are simple and show what paper is actually trying to tell. However, in my opinion, it would be better for this paper to actually show the entire results for their research in table just to make it easier for me to understand. Just understanding the result with texts was hard job for me. If the authors include a table to show their results, it would be better for me to  grasp the message of the paper.
